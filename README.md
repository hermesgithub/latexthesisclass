A .cls file for a PhD thesis.

* This is the preamble for a PhD thesis written in LaTeX.

* I have based this of a number of sources, that I failed to take adequate notes on. If anyone feels wronged, then email me at git+dgershlick[at]gmail.com to get it sorted.

* The PDF file gives a rough guide to using the cls file. There are a number of shortcuts etc I used. I strongly encourage users to browse the file.

* The bibliography that fits my style should be included at the appropiate place. The LaTeX is in the bibilography txt file within this repo.
